# Personal Fork/Clone Notes
This is a personal copy of the [Nextjs App Router course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started), created locally via
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```
for trying out public deployment & integration with GitHub using their free Vercel account.

See [chapter 6](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database) of the course for details on pushing to GitHub, and Vercel account/deployment setup. Turned out it was simple and quick as described.

In 2024, it is now tricker to push local code to GitHub via the command line because of the authentication required.  It is easier to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), sign in, and upload the code this way.

Additional tweaks to the course tutorial:
- app/ui/dashboard/nav-links: Added select/hover borders to nav items.
